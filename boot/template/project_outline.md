# Project Outline

- What is the data?
- Which preprocessing-steps make sense?
- What is the input, output dimension?
- What kind of blocks are needed?
- Overall architecture of the model.
- Optimizer. Which different variables are there for the optimizer?
- Loss function. Which loss-functions make sense?
- Pull these parameters out of the model (No idea how though...)
- json for hyperparameter-specification?

# Important Hyperparameters

- number of layers (ok), activation functions, dropout rate
- number of epochs, learning rate
-

# JSON for hyperparameter-specification
- fix random seed!
- list of layers
- activation function
- dropout rate
- loss function
- optimizer

- max-epochs
- learning rate

- version data

- log metrics!!!

# Automatic hyperparameter-tuning
???
